## Overview
* This circuit is intoduced to me as a task and part of my summer 2021 training in [Smart Methods](https://www.s-m.com.sa) Saudi Company.
* This circuit is the arm of our robotic.

## Description 
* The circuit contains six servomotors with intial degree value of the position which is zero as assumption. The value will be determined by the Mechanical Engineer.
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic will measure the distanceo and based on the signals our motors will move.   
* LCD displays the measured distance from the ultrasonic and different message for each case.
